# Terraform AWS Foundations

This repository documents my hands-on learning and experimentation with AWS infrastructure concepts using Terraform.

The focus is on building foundational AWS knowledge (IAM, VPC networking, EC2, security boundaries) and reinforcing vendor-neutral cloud administration and infrastructure-as-code practices.

This is an evolving learning project, not a production environment.
