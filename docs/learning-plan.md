# Learning Plan

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with AWS and Terraform.

The focus is on:
- Understanding core AWS services
- Applying infrastructure-as-code principles
- Reinforcing vendor-neutral cloud administration skills

This is a learning repository, not a production reference.
